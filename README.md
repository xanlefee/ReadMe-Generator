# ReadMe-Generator
A README generator that uses inquirer & the command line. 

In this project, I created a README.md file generator that uses the command line to dynamically generate a professional README. The project uses ES6 & Node.js, demonstrating this functionality inside visual studio.

Firstly, I designed the structure and then created the questions that would inform the content of the README. Then I ensured data would be displayed correctly in the generated file using template literals.

I used input prompts for most of the questions and a range of choices for the license. Now users can quickly generate a professional README for their projects with the correct structure & formatting.
